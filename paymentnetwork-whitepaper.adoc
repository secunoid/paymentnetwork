== Abstract
A one-paragraph description of what the paper is about. Do not state the conclusion here; simply tell the reader what the purpose of the paper is. Customers frequently read only the abstract and conclusion of white papers, so provide material that gives them a good reason to read the details.

The ability to transfer money is the biggest roadblock for consumers.  In order to make a payment, users have to first understand the charges a particular network provider will charge.

Our solution will attempt to reduce, if not remove the friction when using payment rails.

== Background

Payments can be between:

. User to User
. User to Business
. Business to Business

Payments can be classified into two groups:

. Within the borders
. Across the borders

When payments are being face to face, usually there is no verification required.  

When payments are being sent electronically, regardless of where the sender or the receiver is, a few hurdles surface:

* <<AML, AML>> Regulations
* <<KYC, KYC>> Regulations
